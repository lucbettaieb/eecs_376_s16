# Merry Actionserver
This package aims to provide a simple interface for controlling Merry's arm to pick up a can for EECS 376 / 476.

 - Once Jinx approaches the table, students will supply coordinates of the centroid of the can they wish to pick up.  This will be done with PCL processing using the Kinect on top of Merry.
 - Merry will then to a broad approach to the can using her right arm.  This will have the gripper attached to it.
 - Merry will then open her gripper.
 - Merry will then to a slow approach to the can.
 - Merry will then close her gripper.
 - Finally, Merry will raise her arm up so that the can is being held.
